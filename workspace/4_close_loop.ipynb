    "-   in order to evaluate how well our model does in production, versus in offline evaluation on a held-out test set,\n",
    "-   and also to get new “production data” on which to re-train the model when its performance degrades.\n",

    "-   We could set aside a portion of production data for a human to label.\n",
    "-   We could set aside samples where the model has low confidence in its prediction, for a human to label. These extra-difficult samples are especially useful for re-training.\n",
    "-   We could allow users to give explicit feedback about whether the label assigned to their image is correct or not. This feedback may be sparse (some users won’t bother giving feedback even if the label is wrong) and noisy (some users may give incorrect feedback). We can get human annotators to label this data, too.\n",
    "-   We could allow users to explicitly label their images, by changing the label that is assigned by the classifier. This feedback may be sparse (some users won’t bother giving feedback even if the label is wrong) and noisy (some users may give incorrect feedback).\n",
